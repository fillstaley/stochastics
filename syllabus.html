<p>This course is an introduction to the mathematical theory of stochastic processes from a “user’s” perspective. The goals are to become familiar with properties of and techniques for a range of commonly encountered stochastic processes, from an advanced mathematical perspective. The topics we will cover are chosen to be widely useful in modeling in a wide range of fields: we aim to cover the standard toolbox for stochastic modeling and analysis, from biology to mathematics to physics. We will emphasize commonalities across the various mathematical structures, in particular emphasizing the use of generators (and associated semigroups).</p>
<p>For instance: suppose that a random height function begins at zero and takes independent, random steps either up or down. You probably know that the height at some distance away is approximately Gaussian, but did you know that the set of height differentials between each pair of points on the path form a basis for an isometry of <span class="math inline"><em>L</em><sup>2</sup>(ℝ<sub>+</sub>)</span> and a linear space of square-integrable random variables? We’ll see how to use this fact to model much more general random processes, why <span class="math inline">$e^{t \frac{d^2}{dx^2}}$</span> is convolution with <span class="math inline">$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-x^2/2}$</span>, how to generalize this fact, and why it is useful.</p>
<p><em>Prerequisites:</em> Students should have a good understanding of linear algebra and either probability or analysis. We won’t be assuming knowledge of measure theory, but will be making somewhat informal use of function spaces (e.g., <span class="math inline"><em>L</em><sup>2</sup>(ℝ)</span>).</p>
<p><em>Winter 2019:</em> This course is designed to complement a subsequent course, taught by Yashar Ahmadian, which will cover aspects of dynamical systems, bifurcation theory, diffusions and stochastic differential equations, point processes, and random matrix theory.</p>
<h2 id="course-work-and-assessment">Course work and assessment</h2>
<p>Every student will be responsible for writing up, in LaTeX, notes for one section of class (two or three days worth on a topic). In addition, students will be expected to turn in the solution to one problem, chosen from a selection throughout the course.</p>
