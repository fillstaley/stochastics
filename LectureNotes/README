This folder contains the material for the lecture notes.
It is a modular document.
  The Master folder contains the master file and the documentclass file.
  The Main folder contains the lecture notes themselves.

Each lecture should be its own file.
The file name should be ASPLecture##
  (although it technically doesn't matter as long as it has no spaces).
There is a template file in this folder.
If the file is being included with the notes,
  or is in a cloned folder structure with the master file,
  then the |subfiles| documentclass should be used.
If the file is being compiled on its own,
  the |fillsntsx| documentclass should be used.
